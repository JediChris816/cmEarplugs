Earplugs script for Arma 3 Epoch (EPAH safe)

This will add an earplugs menu to everycar on the server as well as any new cars from traders.

All you have to do is get in the car once if it does not already have the earplugs menu.

It will also remove the earplugs when you get out of a vehicle.


Installation is pretty straight forward.

Copy the files in the mission folder.

Edit your battleye filters. Instructions are in the folder.

And you are good to go.
