This script will add my earplugs script. It will let you do the following:

- NEW: You can now press F4 to manually toggle your earplugs at any time.
- NEW: You can select from different keys if you don't want to use F4.
- NEW: Config.sqf will allow you to configure a bunch of random stuff.
- Auto-insert and remove earplugs when getting in and out of vehicles.
- Inserting earplugs reduces volume down to about 25 percent.
- Removing earplugs restores volume to 100 percent.
